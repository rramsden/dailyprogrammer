It is that time of year again when across some of the lands you hear about March Madness and NCAA Basketball.
People ask about your brackets and how you are doing in your predictions. 

Of course to those of us who perform the art of coding we always get a bit confused by this.
You see we think of brackets like [] or {} or () to use in our many wonderful languages.
As it turns out in a bit of madness some messages got the rough bracket treatment.
I am asking you to decode these messages by removing the brackets and decoding the message.
The order of the message should be ordered for the deepest bracket strings to be displayed first then the next deepest and so forth.
